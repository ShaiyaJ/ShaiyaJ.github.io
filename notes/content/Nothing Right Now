At the moment the "blog" is empty.

I decided to have a cleanup of the website, and one of the first things that took a hit was the blog. It is now the "notes", which I hope will give it a bit more of a technical focus without completely removing my ability to write about non-technical things.

I'll be completely rewriting the blog code, as it was largely a quick "get it done" ordeal and has now gone through 3 different faces of website (meaning there are leftovers from 3 generations of adaptation!)

I intend this notes section to hold project showcases and "practical" posts on other hobbies or things I do in real life.
