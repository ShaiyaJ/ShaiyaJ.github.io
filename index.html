        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a hobbyist programmer who is focused on both high and low-level development. I intend this website to complement my Github - allowing me to present my projects in a way that Github doesn't allow.</p>

        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>I enjoy working across various domains. Typically this will be lower-level projects in C/Rust, but sometimes it's just small scripts written in Python or web utilities written in Javascript.</p>
        <p>I aim to do more work in compiler design and operating systems, as I find these lower-level tasks very interesting.</p>
        
        <p>My <a href="portfolio">portfolio</a> hosts a brief overview of my projects. The <a href="blog">blog</a> may also showcase some of my projects in more technical detail than my portfolio allows for.</p>

        <h3>Skills & Tools</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Languages: C, Rust, Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, React</li>
            <li>Tools: Git, Github, Linux, Cargo, Pypi</li>
            <li>Interests: Compilers, operating systems, P2P networking, build utilities</li>
            <li>Experience: 2 years tutoring experience in Computer Science</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Iâ€™m currently open to opportunities, especially if it's in systems programming, developer tooling, or educational technology. Feel free to <a href="contact">get in touch</a>.</p>

        <h3>Hobbies and Pastimes</h3>
        <p>My main hobbies are phonetics and literature. I aim one day to be able to use my phonetics knowledge to help other people. I also dabble in the guitar.</p>
        <p>My favourite pastime is Mahjong. I play online and in real life, and I sometimes teach other people how to play.</p>
