        <h1>Shaiya J.</h1>
        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I'm a hobbyist programmer who is focused on both high and low level development. I intend this website to complement my Github - with my portfolio and blog providing a formal presentation and informal musings on my past projects.</p>
        <p>My activity may be very patchy, as I'm attending school and don't want to get too sidetracked.</p>
        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>I don't really have a specific area I stick to when making things - I just work on whatever I have ideas for. Typically this will be lower level things in C/Rust, but sometimes it's just small scripts written in Python or web utilities written in Javascript. I don't have many completed projects at the moment since I have the tendency to jump ship as soon as I have a new idea, but when I do complete something that I think is neat I'll put it on the <a href="/blog">blog</a> or <a href="portfolio">portfolio</a>.</p>
        <p>My main interests at the moment are in low-level programming and peer to peer networking. So, when things do get finished, expect to see a lot of that. I also find myself accidentally making games using obscure/unconventional methods (although, I wouldn't consider myself a game developer at heart). All of these projects are hobbyist, I consider them learning experiences for me to take forward into future projects.</p>
        <h3>Other hobbies/pastimes</h3>
        <p>I may talk about my other hobbies on the blog, especially if I make projects geared towards those other hobbies.</p>
        <p>My main hobbies are phonetics and literature. I particularly like the works of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ry%C5%ABnosuke_Akutagawa">芥川龍之介</a> (Ryūnosuke Akutagawa).</p>
        <p>My favourite pastime is Mahjong. I play online and in real life, and I sometimes teach other people how to play.</p>
        <h2>Using this website</h2>
        <p>Parts of the website are still under progress. But there is a working blog, which is where you'll find most of my incoherent ramblings.</p>
        <p>I wrote this website to be very quickly functional, so parts of it will probably change as I focus on (HEAVILY) cleaning it up. I've been wanting a place to display my other projects in a clean(er) format than Github repos allows. I am by no means a web developer - so development may be slow.</p>
