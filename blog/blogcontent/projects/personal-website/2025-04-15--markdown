!So, how does it work?!

Well I cheated *a little bit*. 

I didn't want to have to write out tags because that takes a #long# time. So, instead, I replaced the tags with single characters.

I can also disable this custom markdown at any time, since it only applies to content inside tags with blogmd in their class list.

Because of how it's made, I can make different templates under different classnames - which will streamline the post creation process if I do ever decide to write diffrent "genres" of post.

!And here's me disabling it!

whoops. Can you tell I'm also using this post as a test?
